    <h2><i class="fas fa-microphone"></i> Interview Session</h2>
    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/800x400/?interview,job" alt="Interview Image">
    <p>This simulated job interview in English allowed me to experience the dynamics of a real professional conversation. I selected a series of relevant questions and responded with formal tone and structure. This exercise improved my vocabulary related to employment, time management, teamwork, and personal strengths. It also boosted my confidence in speaking English fluently in front of an audience or interviewer. These skills are fundamental in today’s multicultural job markets.</p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-file-signature"></i> Cover Letter Example</h2>
    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/800x400/?cover-letter,writing" alt="Cover Letter Image">
    <p>Creating a professional cover letter in English taught me how to be persuasive yet concise. I researched job offers, tailored my letter accordingly, and made sure to highlight my achievements using action-oriented language. The process deepened my understanding of professional writing and allowed me to use cohesive devices and vocabulary suitable for international recruitment. A well-structured cover letter can make a remarkable difference in getting hired.</p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-headphones-alt"></i> Pronunciation Practice</h2>
    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/800x400/?microphone,speech" alt="Pronunciation Image">
    <p>Recording my voice while pronouncing job-related terminology was a game-changer. I compared my speech with native English speakers and made constant adjustments in stress, rhythm, and intonation. The process helped eliminate fossilized errors and made my spoken English clearer and more fluent. Pronunciation is often underestimated, but it's crucial to ensure effective communication, especially in remote interviews or global work environments.</p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Critical Thinking and Media Literacy</h2>
    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/800x400/?critical-thinking,media" alt="Critical Thinking Image">
    <p>Critical thinking involves analyzing and evaluating information to make sound judgments. In this reflection, I explored how media literacy empowers people to question sources, spot logical fallacies, and resist manipulation. These abilities are invaluable in academic research, workplace decisions, and everyday interactions. We live in an era of information overload, and the ability to sift truth from bias defines responsible digital citizenship and lifelong learning.</p>

  <section id="crime">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i> Reflection on Crime and Punishment</h2>
    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/800x400/?literature,books" alt="Crime and Punishment Image">
    <p><em>Crime and Punishment</em> by Fyodor Dostoevsky is more than a novel; it is a study of the human soul. In this reflection, I examined how the narrative explores themes of morality, justice, mental health, and redemption. Raskolnikov’s internal conflict mirrors today’s social and ethical dilemmas, such as inequality, guilt, and the role of punishment in society. This analysis allowed me to connect classic literature with modern challenges in workplace ethics and social structures.</p>
