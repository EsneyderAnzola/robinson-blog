    <h2><i class="fas fa-microphone-lines"></i> Interview Session</h2>
    <img src="images/Interview Session.jpg" alt="Interview Session">
    <p>This simulated job interview experience in English helped me understand formal questioning, improve my fluency, and increase my self-confidence. Practicing situational responses, I could demonstrate adaptability, leadership, and effective communication. Reflecting on the experience, I realized the importance of non-verbal cues, professional language, and strategic storytelling to stand out during a competitive selection process.</p>

  <section id="cover">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i> Cover Letter Example</h2>
    <img src="images/Cover Letter Example.jpg" alt="Cover Letter Example">
    <p>Writing a cover letter in English taught me how to present myself persuasively using concise language. I emphasized my most valuable skills and experiences relevant to the job I was applying for. The process pushed me to evaluate job descriptions critically and write customized letters for specific roles. It’s not just about writing—it’s about strategically promoting your value in the global job market.</p>

  <section id="pronunciation">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i> Pronunciation Practice</h2>
    <img src="images/Pronunciation Practice.jpg" alt="Pronunciation Practice">
    <p>By recording and analyzing my pronunciation of job-related vocabulary, I was able to refine aspects like stress, rhythm, and intonation. I repeated words and phrases while comparing my output with native speakers. This led to better fluency, improved confidence, and more accurate speech patterns. Effective pronunciation supports better interpersonal understanding, especially in professional settings.</p>

  <section id="critical">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Critical Thinking and Media Literacy</h2>
    <img src="images/Critical Thinking and Media Literacy.jpg" alt="Critical Thinking and Media Literacy">
    <p>In a world flooded with information, critical thinking and media literacy are essential. I reflected on how analyzing media sources, identifying bias, and evaluating credibility can shape informed opinions. These skills are vital not only for academic writing but also for making reasoned decisions at work. I concluded that developing these abilities leads to ethical behavior, logical judgment, and resistance to manipulation.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="crime">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-gavel"></i> Reflection on Crime and Punishment</h2>
    <img src="images/Reflection on Crime and Punishment.jpg" alt="Reflection on Crime and Punishment">
    <p>Fyodor Dostoevsky’s novel made me reflect on complex moral and psychological questions. In my analysis, I connected the character Raskolnikov’s guilt and reasoning with modern workplace ethics and justice. The book helps understand how people rationalize wrongdoing and how society responds to it. It’s a reminder that literature not only entertains but teaches empathy, ethical reasoning, and the importance of redemption.</p>
