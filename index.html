    <h2><i class="fas fa-microphone"></i> Interview Session</h2>
    <p>This section presents a simulated job interview in English. The questions were carefully selected to reflect real-life scenarios, helping develop fluency, vocabulary range, and professional articulation. Through this activity, I enhanced my listening and speaking skills while training for job-related interactions. The dialogue reflects an understanding of workplace language and structures that are expected in international contexts.</p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-envelope-open-text"></i> Cover Letter Example</h2>
    <p>This cover letter demonstrates my ability to write in formal English and effectively present my skills and background. It highlights key aspects of persuasive writing, clarity, and structure. I also focused on tailoring the letter to a specific job, showing awareness of employer expectations and professional standards in communication. Writing this letter helped me understand the importance of tone, organization, and vocabulary in career advancement.</p>

  <section id="pronunciation">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i> Pronunciation Practice</h2>
    <p>In this entry, I recorded my voice pronouncing key terms and full sentences used in business English. This practice has improved my fluency and intonation while identifying areas that need work such as stress and rhythm. I used tools such as online dictionaries, YouGlish, and native speaker recordings to compare and adjust. Pronunciation is a critical aspect of communication, and this practice has helped reduce misunderstandings and improved my confidence when speaking in English.</p>

  <section id="critical">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Critical Thinking and Media Literacy</h2>
    <p>In today's world, critical thinking and media literacy are fundamental skills. In this reflection, I analyze how developing a questioning attitude towards information helps avoid manipulation and misinformation. These skills are essential for both academic and workplace success. I explored how to verify sources, differentiate between opinion and fact, and recognize bias in media content. The ability to think critically empowers individuals to make informed decisions and engage in meaningful discussions.</p>

  <section id="crime">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Reflection on Crime and Punishment</h2>
    <p>Fyodor Dostoevskyâ€™s <em>Crime and Punishment</em> offers deep insight into the psychology of guilt, justice, and redemption. Through my critical reflection, I examined how the novel reveals social and ethical problems relevant to both historical and modern contexts. I analyzed the struggles of Raskolnikov as a representation of the conflict between ideology and humanity. This reading enhanced my ability to think deeply, interpret literary themes, and relate them to contemporary workplace and societal challenges.</p>
